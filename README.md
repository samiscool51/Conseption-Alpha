# Conseption-Alpha
This is the Official Conseption Alpha Bug Tracker.

It helps me track bugs/issues/glitchs with Conseption Alpha and resolve them.

Please report bugs occording to the bug report template for your bug report to be accepted and looked into.

If it fails to meet the bug report template requiremrents it will be removed and the issue will not be looked into.

The reason the requiremrnts are there is to ensure that all bugs are catgorised and that vital info is presented in a understandable way to help me track down the issue and fix it.
